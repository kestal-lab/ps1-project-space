KESHAV MITTAL
Codes for insert,delete and search added, both differently and in one common file(named client.cpp). Code from client.cpp can be directly copied to a machine and complied and run. I have populated tree with 4 values. Inorder Traversal has been used to see the populated tree. Deleted one value and also searched one.
